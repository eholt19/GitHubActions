# GitHub Actions CI/CD Demo

This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Render.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Testing:** Cypress (component tests)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** [Render](https://githubactions-d5f5.onrender.com)

## üèóÔ∏è How CI/CD Works

- **Cypress Tests on PR:**  
  When a Pull Request is made to the `develop` branch, GitHub Actions runs Cypress tests automatically.
- **Deploy on Main:**  
  When code is pushed or merged to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions triggers a deploy on Render via a deploy hook.  
  This ensures that the latest version is always live.
